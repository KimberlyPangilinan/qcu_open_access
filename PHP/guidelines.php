        </div>
        <div class="category w-100">
        <div class="s-2">
        <h3>Initial Check and Review</h3>
        <p>The Managing Editor will review submitted papers received by the Editorial Board to ensure
            that they are adequately prepared and adhere to the journal’s ethical policies. Manuscripts
            will be rejected before peer-review if they do not comply with the journal’s principles or meet
            its requirements. Manuscripts will be returned to the researchers for revision and
            resubmission if they are not properly prepared. Following the reviews, the Managing Editor
            will confer with the journal’s Editor-in-Chief to determine if the contribution is within the
            publication’s scope. At this time, no assessment of the work’s potential impact will be made.
            The Editor-in-Chief will double-check any rejection decisions made at this stage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s-2">
        <h3>Peer-Review</h3>
        <p>Following the initial review, three experts will conduct a double-blind peer review of the
            manuscript, where the authors’ identities will be kept hidden from the reviewers. These
            experts will include faculty members from within and outside the University, industry experts,
            and the journal’s Editorial Board members. Reviewers should not have published any
            research works with any of the co-authors in the last five years, and they should not be
            working or collaborating with the co-authors’ department or college at the moment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s-1">
        <h3>Editorial Decision and Revision</h3>
        <p>Following the peer-review process, the managing editor will inform the researchers of the
            decision of the editor-in-chief as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Accept with Minor Revisions:</b> Based on the reviewer’s suggestions, the article is in
            principle approved after minor changes have been made. Authors have five to ten
            days to complete the minor changes.</li>
            <li><b>Reconsider after Major Revisions:</b> The manuscript’s acceptance would be
            dependent on the revisions made by the author/s. If part of the reviewer’s comments
            cannot be amended, the author must respond in detail or present a rebuttal. Just one
            round of major revisions is allowed. Within 20 days, the authors must resubmit the
            revised work, and it will be given back to the reviewer for additional feedback.</li>
            <li><b>Reject and Encourage Resubmission:</b> The manuscript will be rejected if more
            analysis and experiments are necessary to support the study’s findings. The authors
            will be urged to resubmit the manuscript after the additional analysis is finished.</li>
            <li><b>Reject:</b> The article has multiple inaccuracies and/or makes no significant original
            contribution. There will be no invitation to resubmit to the journal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the reviewers’ comments should be addressed in a table that contains the comment, the
            author’s (s) reaction or action, and the related page where the comment was made. When
            the authors disagree with a reviewer, they must express their disagreement clearly and
            concisely.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="s-2">
        <h3>PUBLICATION</h3>
        <p>Following approval, the paper will go through copy-editing and author proofing, final edits,
            pagination checking, and publication in the journal.</p>
        </div>

                    <li>Manuscripts submitted for publication in any QCU Journal should not contain any
                        previously published information. If the researcher uses previously published figures
                        or images, the researcher must seek the copyright holder’s permission to publish
                        under the Creative Commons-BY license.</li>

                    <li>Plagiarism, fabrication, falsification of data, manipulation of the image, and
                        other forms of research misconduct are not tolerated.</li>
                    <li>Plagiarism refers to the act of representing as one’s original work the creative
                        works of another, without appropriate acknowledgment of the author or
                        source, even the researcher’s work (The University of Melbourne, n.d.).</li>
                    <li>The manuscript will be rejected if any research misconduct is discovered
                        throughout the peer-review process.</li>
                    <li>If any scientific misconduct is discovered after the manuscript has been
                        published, the editorial board may issue a correction or retract the paper.</li>
                </ul>
                    <li>Our editors will investigate any claims of research misconduct in publication. Proper
                        steps will be considered to correct or retract the article if there is proof of misconduct.
                        When publishing with the Pahina, authors are expected to follow the most
                        acceptable ethical publication procedures.</li>
